# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This my first javascript project. (8/4/2025)
Finished the project on (10/4/2025), hope to get back to it soon and add a GUI.

This is a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game implemented in JavaScript. The game consists of 5 rounds where the player competes against the computer. In each round:

1. The player inputs their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) via a prompt.
2. The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
3. The choices are compared to determine the winner of the round based on the classic rules: 
   - Rock beats Scissors.
   - Scissors beats Paper.
   - Paper beats Rock.

Scores for both the player and the computer are tracked throughout the game. After 5 rounds, the final scores are displayed, and the overall winner is announced. If the scores are tied after 5 rounds, the game declares a tie. The game includes alerts and console logs to provide feedback on each round's outcome and the final result.

This implementation is beginner-friendly and demonstrates the use of functions, conditionals, and loops in JavaScript. It can be run in any browser's console or integrated into a web page for interactive gameplay.
